# Physical Activity and Machine Learning

## Research aim
This report aims to develop a reliable system which helps to predict the amount, and type of physical exercise a person completes using machine learning techniques. 

To achieve this goal, my report does the following:
1. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
2. Investigated the relationship between attribute 1 and attribute 2
3. Developed and tested a model incorporating attributes... to predict the amount + type of exercise completed.
